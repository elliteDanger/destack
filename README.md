# Destack Starter

This example shows the a very basic version of Destack. There is one page, `pages/index.js`, which shows the visual editor in development and the compiled version in production and one API route, `pages/api/builder/handle.js`, that makes all the magic. After setting it up, you don't have to worry about it anymore.

## Deploy your own
